# DEBUGGING AUTOMATIC WATER LEVEL CONTROLLER

The first part of this project is to detect the levels of water accurately as it is critical for the motor to start running/stop running automatically. So, we set up different wires in the tank (or whatever stores water) corresponding to different levels of water required to be measured. In order to check whether the set-up is working or not, we could connect a buzzer or a LED to the microcontroller and code it in such a way that the buzzer goes off or the LED lights up when water reaches a particular level. We repeat the process for all the levels and check whether everything works or not. 

If it is not working, check whether there is some mistake in the pin initialisations in the code. The buzzer or the LED may not be working. The connections given to the tank may be loose. In this way, we can debug this part of the circuit.

Next, we connect the motor to the microcontroller and code it so that it starts running when the level of water is low, keeps on running till the level of water is high, and stops running when the level of water is high. Then, when the level of water becomes low, the motor starts to run automatically and the cycle repeats. If there is some bug here, you might want to repeat the above process of debugging the water level detector. If everything is fine there, then check the code, if the functionality of starting and stopping the motor described here is exactly what is given in the code. If it is fine as well, then there is some problem with the motor itself, unless there is some mistake in the pin initialisations in the code.

I have included the additional feature of an LCD displaying the level of water as well as the state of motor. These two parts can be debugged separately. If there is some problem in the LCD displaying the level of water (it is not working at all, or displaying incorrect levels), then check whether the level of water is detected properly using the method described at the start of this file. If it is fine there, then check the code for proper pin initialisation and proper display. If it is fine there, then there is some problem with the LCD. 

If the state of the motor is not being displayed properly, then we can manually run and stop running the motor using some circuit external to the water level controller and check whether the corresponding state of the motor is displayed on the LCD. If it is not working, then have a look at the code. If it is working externally, but not working when connected to the water level controller, then the issue might be because of more power being drawn.
